# AI-Upscaler

Its easy to read and edit the code in [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com)

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to PATH for this

You need [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed to PATH for this | [Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/JR36oH35Fgg)

Doanload these
 - [ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN)
 - [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)

Extract both

Drag the "Real-ESRGAN-master" folder into the "ESRGAN-master" folder

Then drag the "ESRGAN-master folder" into the folder into the same folder where you extracted "Quality Enhancer"

Go into the "Real-ESRGAN-master" folder, click the address bar (top bar that shows where you are in the file explorer), type "cmd" to get to the console for that folder

 - DOWNLOAD THE DEPENDENCIES & SETUP ESRGAN
 - Normal Method
Type "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then type "python setup.py"

Close the console window when that is finished

 - Noob Method

Go to [this repository](https://github.com/ToastedNub/Upscaler-Noob-Thing), download it as a zip

Extract the zip

Put the "Build" file into the "Real-ESRGAN-master" folder, which you should have dragged into the "ESRGAN-master" folder

Run the "Build" file once you place it in there

 - HOW IT WORKS
Place an Image or Video into the "MEDIA" folder

FOR A GIF: (If you want to use a Gif, you need to turn it into a video, use the script on it, then turn it back into a Gif)

Run the "Image" file for Images

Run the "Video" file for Videos

Run the "AcidVideo" file on a low fps video, to give it a trippy effect
