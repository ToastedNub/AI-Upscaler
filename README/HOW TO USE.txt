 --- NOTES ---

THIS ONLY WORKS FOR IMAGES AND VIDEOS

IF YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR A GIF, YOU NEED TO CONVERT YOUR GIF INTO A VIDEO, THEN YOU CAN USE THIS SCRIPT ON IT, THEN CONVERT IT BACK INTO A GIF

YOU NEED FFMPEG INSTALLED TO SYSTEM PATH FOR THIS TO WORK
 - FFMPEG DOWNLOAD: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
 - FFMPEG PATH TUTORIAL: https://youtu.be/JR36oH35Fgg

YOU NEED PYTHON INSTALLED TO SYSTEM PATH FOR THIS TO WORK


 --- BUILD THE ESRGAN FILES ---

Go into the "Quality Enhancer" folder, then in the "ESRGAN-mnaster" folder, then in the "Real-ESRGAN-master" folder

Run the "Build" file


 --- INSTRUCTIONS ---

 - Run the "Install Requirements" file, which is inside of the "DOWNLOADS" folder, along with the Python and FFMPEG downloads

 - Add your file into the "MEDIA" folder (Images or Videos)

 - For an Image, run the "Image" file, for a Video run the "Video" file, the "AcidVideo" file works best for low fps videos, it creates a trippy effect

 - After the command prompt closes, your finished file will be in the "OUTPUT" folder

 - If it created any temp files in the script directory, or any new temp folders, you can delete those after the console closes

 --- IMPORTANT ---

If you start to lag while running these scripts, go into the "SCRIPTS" folder

look for the line that says this

"--tile", "1024", # LOWER THIS NUMBER IF YOU LAG (1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) (do not use 0, this will process everything at once)

change the number "1024" to a lower number (DO NOT USE "0") (THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU HAVE A GRAPHICS CARD (GPU))
